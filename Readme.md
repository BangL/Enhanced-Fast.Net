#Enhanced Fast.Net

This mod is a visually upgraded Version of Lastbullet_Big Bushy Beard's 'Fast.Net Standalone'.  
It started with the background panels, because the list was very hard to read with the blue default background.  
(Maybe my Monitor is just crap?  :P )

###It includes:
- __FastNet Standalone__, made by _Big Bushy Beard_, modified by me
	- Removed filters from the Serverlist
	- Added Background panels to different parts of the UI
	- Made labels on the left side permanent
	- Created a button panel in the bottom left for Filters, Sidejobs, Brooker, etc.
	- Added working keyboard shortcut support for Filters
	- Added marking of friends lobbies in the serverlist
- __Persistent Filter Settings__, made by _Seven_
- __Reconnect to Server__, made by _Luffy_
	- Probably causes issues, if you have the standalone version installed too...

###TODO:
- Add aditional filter options
- Remove crimenet Map from the importet crimenet UIs
- Restructure the way, the reconnect script is implemented
