#Enhanced Fast.Net

This mod is a visually upgraded Version of Lastbullet_Big Bushy Beard's 'Fast.Net Standalone'.

######It includes:
- FastNet Standalone, made by Big Bushy Beard, modified by me
	- Removed filters from the Serverlist
	- Added Background panels to different parts of the UI
	- Made labels on the left side permanent
	- Created a button panel in the bottom left for Filters, Sidejobs, Brooker, etc.
	- Added working keyboard shortcut support for Filters
	- Added marking of friends lobbies in the serverlist
- Persistent Filter Settings, made by Seven
- Reconnect to Server, made by Luffy
	- Probably causes issues, if you have the standalone version installed too...
